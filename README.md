## Release process

We use [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to generate release notes and GitHub release.
It will automatically generate draft release based pull requests data between current version and previous version.
To make new release you need go to [releases](https://github.com/codex-team/codex.docs/releases) page find the latest draft release and mark it as ready.
After creating new release, new git tag will be created and new version will be published.
