## Development

### Set up the environment

Install node version manager and required version of node js

```
$ chmod u+x ./bin/nvm.sh && ./bin/nvm.sh
$ nvm install
```

> For windows use [nvm for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

Install Yarn package manager

> Use `--without-node` flag  because nvm version of Node is used

Or download it directly from the [website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Authentication

To manage pages you need to authorize (available on `/auth`).

To generate password use `yarn generatePassword [password]` command.

## Release process

We use [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to generate release notes and GitHub release.
It will automatically generate draft release based pull requests data between current version and previous version.
To make new release you need go to [releases](https://github.com/codex-team/codex.docs/releases) page find the latest draft release and mark it as ready.
After creating new release, new git tag will be created and new version will be published.
